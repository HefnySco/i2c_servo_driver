### I2C Servo Driver using Arduino

The purpose of this project is to make a simple semi-alternative of **[MW_I2C_ 16-Channel Servo Driver](https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver?view=all "MW_I2C_ 16-Channel Servo Driver") **using Arduino boards.

The project make use of the old and excellent code of iconic **[Multiwii](https://github.com/multiwii/multiwii-firmware "Multiwii")**. As Multiwii has very optimized and flexible code for controlling motor and servos.


People are welcome to add and tune functions.

It is worth to note here that it is very simple to use **[Multiwii protocol](https://github.com/multiwii/multiwii-firmware/blob/upstream_shared/Protocol.cpp "Multiwii protocol")** that is already available to send serial commands instead of using I2C.

**STATUS:** still in developig and need lots of code cleansing.
